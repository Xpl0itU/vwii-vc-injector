# vwii-vc-injector

Edit bin/config and add the Wii U common key

Find online "wii_common_key.bin" and copy it to the bin folder

Edit injector.py and paste the Kirby's Epic Yarn EUR Titlekey

Copy your game to bin and rename it to "game.wbfs" (only tested with wbfs files)

This is only experimental, no packing or any of that fancy stuff yet

YOU'LL HAVE TO PACK THE GAME AND EDIT THE META YOURSELF
